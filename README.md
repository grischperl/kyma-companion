# Kyma Companion

## Status

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/kyma-project/kyma-companion)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/kyma-project/kyma-companion)

## Overview

Kyma Companion provides in-app context-sensitive help and general assistance to Kyma users.

## Prerequisites

Required software:

 - Python 3.12.\*
 - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
 - [Redis server](https://github.tools.sap/kyma/ai-force/blob/main/docs/infrastructure/setup.md#15-redis) <!--the link must be replaced when the OS documentation is available -->

## Manage Dependencies

We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies in the project.
Here's a quick guide on how to add, remove, and update dependencies using Poetry.

### Add and Update Dependencies

To install all the dependencies listed in the `pyproject.toml` file, use the following command:

```bash
poetry install
```

To update a specific dependency to its latest version, use the `poetry update` command followed by the name of the package:

```bash
poetry update {package_name}
```

To add a new dependency to your project, use the `poetry add` command followed by the name of the package you want to add:

```bash
poetry add {package_name}
```

Or, with an exact version:

```bash
poetry add {package_name}@{version}
```

To remove a dependency from your project, you can use the `poetry remove` command followed by the name of the package:

```bash
poetry remove {package_name}
```

## Create and Use Virtual Environments with Poetry

To create a virtual environment for the project, navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command:

```bash
poetry install
```

This creates a new virtual environment and installs the project's dependencies.

### Activate the Virtual Environment

To use the virtual environment, follow this procedure.

> [!NOTE] Run these commands in the root directory of your project, where the `pyproject.toml` file is located.

1. Use `poetry shell` to start a new shell session with the virtual environment activated:

        ```bash
        poetry shell
        ```

   Now, you can run Python and any installed packages in this shell. They will use the virtual environment. 
2. Use `poetry run` to execute a command.
3. Use the `deactivate` command to exit the virtual environment.

If you are a PyCharm user and want to use the virtual environment created by Poetry, follow the [configuration guides](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/poetry.html).

## Use Poe the Poet as Task Runner

[Poe the Poet](https://poethepoet.natn.io/index.html) is a task runner that simplifies running common tasks in a Python project.

To have the command available as `poetry poe <command>` (as seen in the following examples), install poe as a plugin to Poetry:

```bash
poetry self add 'poethepoet[poetry_plugin]'
```

If you don't install this plugin, you must run poe as a script within the Poetry environment using `poetry run poe <command>`.

## Development

### Redis Server 

Before running the application, you must provide the Redis server. It stores the conversation with a large language model (LLM).
Therefore, provide **REDIS_URL** as an environment variable.

For details on how to create a Redis server, read [Create Redis](https://github.tools.sap/kyma/ai-force/blob/main/docs/infrastructure/setup.md#15-redis). <!--the link must be replaced when the OS documentation is available -->
For example, `REDIS_URL="redis://{host or ip}:6379"`

### Running Kyma Companion Locally

You can execute the Kyma Companion locally using the FastAPI framework with the following command:

```bash
poetry run fastapi dev src/main.py --port 8000
```

Or, with a poe task:

```bash
$ poetry poe run-local
```

It is recommended to run Kyma Companion with Poetry because it activates and uses its virtual environment if not activated yet.

> [!NOTE] You cannot run it with Python directly.

### Debugging

Because the companion uses the FastAPI framework, read the following documentation on how to debug the application with the respective IDE:

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/fastapi-project.html#create-project)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-fastapi)

### Configuration

For local development, you can configure LLMs by modifying the `config/config.json` file.
To use a configuration file from a different location, set the `CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to the path of your desired JSON configuration file.

## Code Checks

To execute linting, formatting, and type checking using Ruff, Black, and mypy, respectively use the following command:

```bash
poetry poe codecheck
```

To fix linting and formatting issues, use the following command:

```bash
poetry poe codefix
```

Mypy does not support fixing issues automatically.

### Linting

It is recommended to execute the [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) linting check with the poe lint task with the following command:

```bash
poetry poe lint
```

Alternatively, you can also do it with `ruff check` directly, where Ruff may have a different version in a different virtual environment.

Linting errors can be fixed with the following command, which applies only the safe fixes by default:

```bash
poetry poe lint-fix
```

> [!WARNING]
Use the command with caution, as it may change the code in an unexpected way.

### Formatting

To execute the [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) formatting check with the poe format task, use the following command:

```bash
poetry poe format
```

You can fix formatting erros with the following command:

```bash
poetry poe format-fix
```

### Type Checking

To execute type checking with [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/), use the following command:

```bash
poetry poe typecheck
```

Mypy does not support fixing issues automatically.


## Tests

### Unit Tests

The tests written in the [pytest framework](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) can be executed with the following command:

```bash
poetry poe test
```

Or, with the following command:

```bash
poetry run pytest tests
```

### Integration Tests

For details about integration tests, read the [Integration Tests README file](./tests/integration/README.md).

### Blackbox Tests

For details about blackbox tests, read the [Blackbox Tests README file](./tests/blackbox/README.md).

## Release Process

Release testing and release creation are two separate processes.
